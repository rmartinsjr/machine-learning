    "*According to the page [Choosing the right estimator](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) at [scikit-learn.org](scikit-learn.org), the suggested estimators are [Linear SVC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification), [KNeighbors classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) and an ensemble method, which will be [Gradient Boosting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting). All three are appropriate to the size of the data set and due to their particular nature, offer different approaches to the problem.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LinearSVC\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Linear SVC is a support vector machine classifier with a linear kernel, which is generally used in the industry to classify text, hypertext and images. Support vector machine is a kind of machine learning algorithm that tries to classify data by finding the frontier (also known as hyperplane) that separates the data - in our case, those who fail in the exams. [2]*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Support Vector Machines are known to be highly effective in high dimensional spaces, meaning that it can handle a great number of features and it is also memory efficient. [3]*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *This kind of model will likely over-fit when there are many more features than samples in the dataset, therefore some strategies must be in place to avoid over-fitting, like regularization and choosing/tuning properly the kernel function. [3]*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *This kind of model is a good candidate because our data set has lots of features and a lot more samples, but not enough to use stochastic gradient descent. Support Vector Machines can perform really well in small datasets.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KNeighborsClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "* *KNeighborsClassifiers are used in handwritten digits and image classification. This type of classification works by consulting the dataset and assigning a label to the datapoint based on nearest neighbors, hence called instance-based learning or non-generalizing learning. [4]*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Its strength comes from the fact that it's one of the simplest, yet powerful machine learning algorithm. As the amount of data increases to infinity, it's guaranteed that a two-class KNeighborsClassifier won't yeld an error rate worse than twice the Bayes error rate. [5]*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *KNeighborsClassifier may suffer the Curse of Dimensionality, which in KNeighbors context means that calculating the distance of the neighbors to the datapoint may be time consuming and unhelpful when there are lots of features (neighbors) in the dataset. It's also very sensitive to noise, if present in the dataset. [5]*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *KNeighborsClassifier may be a good candidate, given that students who fail may share similar characteristics and therefore, KNeighborClassifier can compare a student's features to its neighbors and classify him/her as someone who is going to pass or fail at the exams.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Gradient Boosting has been used to build ranking models for information retrieval systems, seach engines and recommender systems, to name a few of them. [6],[7]*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *As a ensemble method, one of its stregnths is using simpler, weaker learners (decision trees usually) and combine them to form strong learners iteratively and at each iteration, putting more weight on where it performed poorly.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Gradient Boosting is known to be harder to fine tune than other methods, but once well adjusted, GB gives good results, usually.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Our dataset has lots of numerical and categorical features, and as such, decision tree based algorithms like Gradient Boosting usually handle them more easily. [8]*\n",
